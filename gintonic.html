            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Martini is believed to have originated in the mid-to-late 19th century, with several theories about its creation. 
                One popular story attributes it to bartender Jerry Thomas, who included a recipe in his 1887 cocktail book.
                The Martini became a symbol of sophistication and elegance in the 20th century, 
                especially during Prohibition and the post-World War II era.</p>
            <p>The Dirty Martini is a variation that emerged in the late 20th century. It gained popularity in the 1990s, 
                although its exact origin is unclear. The Dirty Martini became a staple in bars and is often favored by those 
                who enjoy a saltier twist on the classic cocktail.</p>
